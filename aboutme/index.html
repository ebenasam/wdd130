    <h2>Eben</h2>
    <p>Let me introduce myself, I am from Ghana in the Western part of Africa and I'm currently living in Asankrangwa in Western Region of Ghana. I love going to the gym, playing football and watching football matches as well. I'm currently not married.</p>
    <p>I am a teacher who is currently teaching in one of the government primary schools in Ghana and I love coaching the school's football [soccer] team. I want to learn more about information technology hence, enrolling in BYU-Idaho. I also know that BYU-Idaho will help build my spiritually as well. I want to help the upcoming generation in Ghana to take IT to the next level. Learning web design will help me to achieve this goal.</p>
    <p>I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints since 2007. My favorite scripture quote is Matthew 5:16 and I quote "Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which in heaven.</p>
    <p>Happy to learn with you. Thanks</p>
